# Interactive Portfolio
![cover](./files/cover.png)

Welcome to my portfolio, built using **THREE.js** and showcasing my professional projects and achievements. This portfolio uses an immersive 3D environment with clickable objects to explore various projects. Each project has a unique description, highlighting my involvement and contributions.

This project's scene draws inspiration from **oscarqjh's** portfolio. The Github page of this project is available [here](https://github.com/oscarqjh/threejs-portfolio/tree/main). 

## Features

- **3D Scene**: A dynamic THREE.js-based environment with models, lighting, and animations.
- **Interactive Objects**: Clickable 3D objects linked to specific projects, with transitions and detailed descriptions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced user experience using TWEEN.js for animations.
- **Direct Links**: Access LinkedIn, GitHub, and my CV directly through the interface.
